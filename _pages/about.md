Bernardo Camajori Tedeschini (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. (Hons.) degree in Computer Science Engineering, the M.Sc. (Hons.) degree in Telecommunications Engineering, and the Ph.D. (Hons.) degree in Information Technology from the Politecnico di Milano, in 2019, 2021, and 2024, respectively.

He served as a Visiting Ph.D. Researcher at the Wireless Information and Network Sciences Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA, in 2023 and 2024. In 2021, he was a Visiting Research Scientist at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland, where he worked on the CAFEIN project, focusing on the development and deployment of a federated network platform.
His research interests encompass cooperative machine learning in distributed systems and localization methods.

Dr. Camajori Tedeschini is a recipient of a Ph.D. grant from the Italian Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca (MIUR) and of the Roberto Rocca Doctoral Fellowship, jointly awarded by MIT and Politecnico di Milano. He was recognized with the Prof. Florian Daniel Award for the best Ph.D. thesis in Information Technology at the Politecnico di Milano, the Dimitris N. Chorafas Foundation Award for outstanding scientific contributions, and the Springer Award for an exceptional Ph.D. dissertation in Information Technology.

Bernardo Camajori Tedeschini (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) is pursuing the Ph.D. degree in Information Technology at the Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria (DEIB), Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, since November 2021. He received his M.Sc. (Hons.) degree in Telecommunications Engineering and B.Sc. (Hons.) degree in Computer Science from the Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 2021 and 2019, respectively.

Currently, he is a Visiting PhD Researcher at the Wireless Information and Network Sciences Laboratory, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA. In 2021, he has served as a Visiting Research Scientist at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland, where he worked on the CAFEIN project, focusing on the development and deployment of a Federated network platform.
His research interests encompass federated learning, machine learning for signal processing and sensing over networks, and localization methods.

Mr. Camajori Tedeschini is a recipient of a Ph.D. grant from Italy's Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universit√† e della Ricerca (MIUR) and the Roberto Rocca Doctoral Fellowship, which was jointly awarded by MIT and Politecnico di Milano. He earned both his Bachelor's and Master's degrees with highest honors and he was honored with the best freshmen prize from Politecnico di Milano in 2017.

Bernardo Camajori Tedeschini (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. (Hons.) degree in Computer Science, the M.Sc. (Hons.) degree in Telecommunications Engineering, and the Ph.D. (Hons.) degree in Information Technology from the Politecnico di Milano, in 2019, 2021, and 2024, respectively.

He served as a Visiting Ph.D. Researcher at the Wireless Information and Network Sciences Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA, in 2023 and 2024. In 2021, he was a Visiting Research Scientist at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland, where he worked on the CAFEIN project, focusing on the development and deployment of a federated network platform.
His research interests encompass cooperative machine learning in distributed systems and localization methods.

Dr. Camajori Tedeschini is a recipient of a Ph.D. grant from the Italian Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca (MIUR) and of the Roberto Rocca Doctoral Fellowship, jointly awarded by MIT and Politecnico di Milano. He earned his Bachelor's, Master's, and Ph.D. degrees, all with highest honors, and he was honored with the best freshmen prize from Politecnico di Milano in 2017.
